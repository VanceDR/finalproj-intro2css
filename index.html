                <blockquote>Landsraad is a Dune-themed Berlin School Ambient Music</blockquote>
                <p>I've stumbled upon this album since it piqued me with the album art and the thematic of the album title (as a Dune fan). The music has the atmosphere, anticipation, and flow that captures the essence of the books it is based of.</p>
                <p>The album cover is from the artist's Bandcamp. <a
