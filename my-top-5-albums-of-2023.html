                <img src="images/anchoret.jpg" alt="It All Began with Loneliness by The Anchoret Album Cover" />
                <blockquote>The Anchoret is a Progressive Metal project that combines prog rock sensibilities with
                    modern metal
                    energy.</blockquote>
                <p>What made me like this album is the seamless blend of flutes, saxophone, with the heavy and melodic
                    guitar
                    riffs. Additionally, the transitions between heavy and soft are perfectly blended to give space and
                    let the
                    music breathe.</p>

                <img src="images/koyo.jpg" alt="Would You Miss It by Koyo Album Cover" />
                <blockquote>Koyo is a Melodic Hardcore band with hints of Emo. They are from Long Island NY.
                </blockquote>
                <p>This album is the first that I've heard from the band. Considering that it is their debut album, it
                    is a strong
                    opener to their discography. The melodic hardcore riffs pleasantly scratches my Emo itch.</p>

                <img src="images/mossback.jpg" alt="Skinwalker Social Club by MOSSBACK Album Cover" />
                <blockquote>MOSSBACK is half of the duo GRIM SALVO, which is an Experimental Rap & Hip-Hop with Acoustic
                    and Metal
                    fusions.</blockquote>
                <p>This is the first album released by MOSSBACK, and with the quality of music that they produce in GRIM
                    SALVO, I
                    had high expectations when I started listening to this album and well... it definitely exceeded my
                    expectations
                    and I listen to it regularly. It definitely has the same vibes as the ones that they did with GRIM
                    SALVO but the
                    prominence of acoustic guitar and otherworldly ambiance of this album makes it different from their
                    duo work.

                <img src="images/hailthesun.jpg" alt="Divine Inner Tension by Hail the Sun Album Cover"/>
                <blockquote>Hail The Sun is a California-based Post-Hardcore and Progressive Rock Band, their genre is
                    also mostly
                    coined 'Swancore'.</blockquote>
                <p>This is the latest album from their discography and in my opinion, their best album to date. The
                    singing is
                    outright phenomenal and the lyrical themes are very relatable. The choruses are catchy and
                    sing-a-long-able.</p>

                <img src="images/sleeptoken.jpg" alt="Take me Back to Eden by Sleep Token Album Cover" />
                <blockquote>Sleep Token is a UK-based Progressive Metal band that is notorious for having the band
                    members'
                    identity private. Each member is called 'Vessel'.</blockquote>
                <p>Upon the drop of the first single, 'Chokehold', I knew that this album would top my list in 2023. The
                    album is
                    full of heavy sections, and genre bending compositions from rap, heavy metal, black metal, and even
                    funk. A
                    great album and a must listen from start to finish.</p>
